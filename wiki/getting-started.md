## What is Biohacking?

**Biohacking** is the practice of using science, technology, and self-experimentation to optimize or enhance the human body and mind. It ranges from simple lifestyle changes to implanting technology under the skin.

## Types of Biohacking

### 1. 🥗 Nutritional/Lifestyle Biohacking (Entry Level)

The most accessible form of biohacking—optimizing your biology through what you consume and how you live.

| Practice | Description | Difficulty |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| **Intermittent Fasting** | Time-restricted eating for metabolic benefits | ⭐ Easy |
| **Nootropics** | Cognitive-enhancing supplements | ⭐⭐ Moderate |
| **Sleep Optimization** | Tracking and improving sleep quality | ⭐ Easy |
| **Cold Exposure** | Cold showers, ice baths for hormesis | ⭐⭐ Moderate |
| **Meditation** | Mindfulness and focus training | ⭐ Easy |

### 2. 📊 Quantified Self (Beginner Friendly)

Tracking your body's data to make informed optimization decisions.

| Method | What It Tracks | Tools |
|--------|----------------|-------|
| **Sleep Tracking** | Sleep stages, duration, quality | Oura Ring, Whoop, Apple Watch |
| **Heart Rate Variability** | Stress, recovery, readiness | Polar, Garmin, Elite HRV |
| **Glucose Monitoring** | Blood sugar response to foods | CGMs (Dexcom, Libre, Levels) |
| **Activity Tracking** | Steps, calories, exercise | Any fitness tracker |
| **Mood/Cognition** | Mental performance patterns | Apps like Daylio, Cambridge Brain |

### 3. 🧬 DIY Biology (Intermediate)

Experimenting with biological systems outside traditional lab settings.

| Practice | Description | Risk Level |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| **Gene Testing** | Understanding your genetics | 🟢 Low |
| **Microbiome Hacking** | Optimizing gut bacteria | 🟡 Low-Medium |

## Is Biohacking Right for You?

### Take This Self-Assessment

Answer honestly to gauge if you're ready for technological biohacking:

| Question | Yes | No |
|----------|-----|-----|
| Are you comfortable with medical procedures? | ✓ | |
| Can you commit to proper aftercare? | ✓ | |
| Do you have access to medical care if needed? | ✓ | |
| Are you doing this for yourself (not peer pressure)? | ✓ | |
| Have you researched for at least 3+ months? | ✓ | |
| Can you afford proper equipment and professional installation? | ✓ | |
| Are you prepared for potential complications? | ✓ | |
| Do you understand MRI restrictions? | ✓ | |

**If you answered "No" to any of these, you may want to wait or reconsider.**

### Who Should Wait

🚫 **Don't get implants if:**
- You're under 18 (legal and developmental reasons)
- You have compromised immune systems
- You're prone to keloid scarring
- You're doing it impulsively (wait at least 6 months)
- You can't afford proper installation and materials

## Your First Steps

### Phase 1: Research (1-3 months)

```
Week 1-2:   Read this entire wiki
            │
Week 3-4:   Join online communities
            │
Month 2:    Watch installation videos
            │
Month 3:    Talk to people who have implants
```

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Read all wiki sections thoroughly
- [ ] Join [Dangerous Things Forum](https://forum.dangerousthings.com/)
- [ ] Join [r/biohackers](https://www.reddit.com/r/biohackers/)
- [ ] Watch YouTube videos of installations
- [ ] Read experience reports (good AND bad)

### Phase 2: Start Non-Invasive (2-4 weeks)

Before any implants, experiment externally:

| Experiment | Cost | Learning |
|------------|------|----------|
| **Buy NFC tags** | $10-20 | How NFC works, reading/writing |
| **Get a Proxmark3** | $50-300 | RFID technology, cloning |
| **Wear NFC ring** | $20-50 | Daily use cases, reader compatibility |
| **Use NFC phone features** | Free | Practical applications |

### Phase 3: Decide on Your First Implant (2-4 weeks)

For most beginners, we recommend:

| Implant | Why It's Good for Beginners | Price |
|---------|----------------------------|-------|
| **xNT** | Simple NFC, well-tested, versatile | ~$50 |
| **xEM** | RFID only, even simpler | ~$40 |
| **NExT** | Dual NFC+RFID, best value | ~$70 |

**Not recommended for first implant:**
- ❌ Magnets (higher complication rate)
- ❌ Active/LED implants (more complex)
- ❌ Large implants (more painful, longer healing)
- ❌ Flex implants (require more skill to install)

### Phase 4: Find a Professional Installer

**Never attempt self-installation for your first implant.**

1. Use the [Dangerous Things Partner Map](https://dangerousthings.com/partners/)
2. Look for experienced body modification artists
3. Ask about their implant experience specifically
4. Verify sterilization procedures

### Phase 5: Get Implanted

What to expect:

```
BEFORE (Day of):
├── Don't drink alcohol (24h before)
├── Eat a good meal
├── Bring your implant (sealed)
├── Ask questions!
└── It's okay to be nervous

DURING (~5 minutes):
├── Area cleaned and marked
├── Local anesthetic (optional, often not needed)
├── Needle insertion
├── Implant injected
└── Bandage applied

AFTER (2-4 weeks):
├── Week 1: Keep clean and dry
├── Week 2: Gentle use only
├── Week 3-4: Full functionality
└── 6+ months: Fully settled
```

## Common Myths and Misconceptions

### ❌ Myth vs ✅ Reality

| Myth | Reality |
|------|---------|
| "Implants can be tracked by GPS" | ❌ Passive implants have no GPS or power source—they only work within 1-5cm of a reader |
| "You can get hacked" | ⚠️ Theoretically possible but requires physical proximity (within centimeters) |
| "It's extremely painful" | ❌ Most describe it as a pinch or quick bee sting |
| "MRIs will kill you" | ⚠️ Depends on implant—most small implants are MRI safe, but always inform medical staff |
| "They last forever" | ❌ Most implants last 10-20+ years but aren't truly permanent |
| "It's illegal" | ❌ Legal in most countries for personal use |
| "Insurance won't cover complications" | ⚠️ Generally true—plan for out-of-pocket medical costs if needed |
| "Everyone will notice" | ❌ Most implants are invisible and undetectable by touch after healing |

| **First Implant** | $40 - $100 | Depends on type |
| **Professional Install** | $50 - $150 | Varies by location and installer |
| **Aftercare Supplies** | $20 - $50 | Bandages, antiseptic |
| **Total First Implant** | **$160 - $600** | |

### Ongoing Costs

| Item | Frequency | Cost |
|------|-----------|------|
| Replacement tags/implants | Every 10+ years | $50-100 |
| Reader/writer tools | One-time | $50-300 |
| Associated projects | Varies | Varies |
