# Implantable Tech Notes

## xSIID
- LED glows on scan — good for visual feedback
- NFC tag links to https://www.jgcks.com

## NExT
- Cloned gym access key using Proxmark3
- Works on HID-based readers
- Dual-frequency – programmable for other use cases

## Magnetic Implants
- xG3 v1: Webbing location, limited feedback
- xG3 v2: Improved field strength, same location
- Goal: Find optimal placement and connect with haptic feedback

## Future Ideas
- Implant-based 2FA using left and right hand
- Passive magnetic sensor + feedback wearable
- Implant-encrypted credentials
