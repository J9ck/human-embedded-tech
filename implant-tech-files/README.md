## 🛠️ How to Use

### NFC Payload
The `nfc-payload.txt` file shows how to format NDEF data for NFC implants. Use apps like:
- **NFC Tools** (Android) — Most versatile
- **TagWriter** (Android) — Official NXP app
- **NFC Tools** (iOS) — Limited writing capability

### Proxmark Commands
The `proxmark-commands.txt` file contains commands for the **Proxmark3** with **Iceman firmware**. 

> ⚠️ **Note:** Commands may vary slightly between firmware versions. Always verify with current documentation.

### Implant Notes
Personal observations about real-world implant usage. Your experience may vary based on:
- Implant placement
- Individual physiology
- Reader compatibility
- Environmental factors
