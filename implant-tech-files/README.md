# Subdermal Interface Project

This repo documents my ongoing personal experiments with **implantable technology** — including NFC, RFID, and magnetic chips — to explore real-world use cases for human-device integration.

These implants are part of my body and my engineering journey.

## ⚙️ Implants

| Implant | Type | Purpose | Location |
|--------|------|---------|----------|
| `xSIID` | NFC + LED | Resume link via NFC | Left hand |
| `NExT` | NFC + RFID | Gym key (RFID clone) | Right hand |
| `xG3 v1` | Magnet | Sensory input (EM fields) | Left hand (webbing) |
| `xG3 v2` | Magnet | Stronger magnetic sensing | Right hand (webbing) |

## 🛠️ Tools & Hardware

- **Proxmark3 (Iceman firmware)** – RFID/NFC emulation & cloning
- **NFC Tools / TagWriter (Android)** – Write NDEF data
- **Arduino + RC522 / PN532** – Future hardware prototypes
- **Dangerous Things implant kits** – Implantation-grade hardware

## 🧪 Use Cases

- ✅ Clone RFID badge to `NExT` (gym access)
- ✅ Tap `xSIID` to auto-load [my resume](https://www.jgcks.com)
- 🔄 Passive magnetic feedback via `xG3` implants (motors, transformers)
- 🔜 NFC-based lock system (in progress)

---

## 💡 Lessons & Notes

- RFID compatibility is tricky — not all readers respond the same way
- NFC implants are excellent for physical-world triggers and links
- Magnet placement affects feedback significantly — webbing isn’t ideal
- All implants still fully functional after 2+ years

## 🔐 Security + Biohacking Ethics

This project explores not just how implants work — but what they *mean*:
- How do we secure data inside a body?
- What are the risks of cloned identity or physical spoofing?
- How do we build consent-based, safe embedded tech?
