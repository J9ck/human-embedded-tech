### Understanding the Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Severity | Prevention |
|------|------------|----------|------------|
| **Infection** | Medium | High | Sterile installation, proper aftercare |
| **Rejection** | Low | Medium | Biocompatible materials, proper placement |
| **Migration** | Low | Low | Proper placement, allow healing time |
| **Nerve damage** | Very Low | Medium | Professional installation, proper location |
| **Allergic reaction** | Very Low | Medium | Know your allergies, use tested materials |
| **Device failure** | Low | Low | Quality products, test before installation |
| **MRI complications** | N/A | Varies | Know your implant's MRI safety, disclose to doctors |

### Day of Installation

**Before:**
- [ ] Don't drink alcohol for 24 hours (thins blood)
- [ ] Avoid aspirin/ibuprofen for 24 hours
- [ ] Eat a good meal (prevents fainting)
- [ ] Bring someone for support if nervous
- [ ] Wear comfortable, loose clothing
- [ ] Bring your implant (sealed, sterile)

**During:**
- Ask questions if anything concerns you
- It's okay to be nervous
- Tell installer if you feel faint
- The procedure is usually very quick (1-2 minutes)
- Pain is typically described as a "pinch" or "bee sting"

**What to Expect:**

```
TYPICAL INSTALLATION PROCESS (for x-series implants):

1. PREPARATION
   • Installer puts on gloves
   • Area is cleaned with antiseptic
   • Implant site is marked
   • You may be asked to verify correct location

2. PROCEDURE (takes ~30 seconds to 2 minutes)
   • Skin is tented or held taut
   • Needle is inserted at shallow angle
   • Needle is advanced to create pocket
   • Implant is deposited via plunger
   • Needle is removed

3. IMMEDIATE AFTER
   • Light pressure applied
   • Bandage placed
   • Aftercare instructions given
   • You're done!

PAIN LEVEL: Most describe it as 3-4/10
            Similar to getting blood drawn
            Some feel nothing with adrenaline

- ❌ Apply pressure or sleep on the implant site
- ❌ Engage in heavy physical activity
- ❌ Take blood thinners unnecessarily

### X-Ray and CT Safety

| Imaging Type | Safety | Notes |
|--------------|--------|-------|
| **X-ray** | ✅ Safe | Implant will be visible, won't interfere |
| **CT Scan** | ✅ Safe | May cause artifact in image around implant |
| **MRI** | ⚠️ Varies | Depends on implant type - always disclose |
| **Ultrasound** | ✅ Safe | May help locate implant |
| **PET Scan** | ✅ Safe | No magnetic component |

### Privacy Considerations

| Concern | Risk Level | Mitigation |
|---------|------------|------------|
| **UID cloning** | Medium | Use changeable UID or encrypted implants for security |
| **Tracking** | Very Low | Passive implants have ~1-5cm range - can't be tracked remotely |
| **Data storage** | Low | Be mindful of what you store (no passwords, private keys) |
| **Physical access** | Low | Someone would need to physically hold reader to your implant |
