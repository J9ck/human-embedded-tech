# Getting Started with Human Embedded Technology

Welcome to the Human Embedded Technology Wiki! This guide will help you understand the basics of biohacking and human-technology integration.

## What is Human Embedded Technology?

Human embedded technology refers to devices that are implanted inside the human body to enhance capabilities, provide new functions, or interface with external systems. This includes:

- **RFID/NFC Implants** — Radio-frequency identification chips for access control and data storage
- **Magnetic Implants** — Magnets that provide sensory feedback for electromagnetic fields
- **LED Implants** — Subdermal lights that activate when scanned
- **Biocomputers** — More complex implantable computing devices

## Before You Begin

### Important Considerations

| Factor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Research** | Thoroughly understand what you're getting into before any procedure |
| **Risks** | All implants carry risks including infection, rejection, and complications |
| **Reversibility** | Consider whether the modification can be safely removed |
| **Medical Disclosure** | Always inform healthcare providers about your implants |

### Prerequisites

Before exploring implants, we recommend:

1. **Join the Community**
   - [Dangerous Things Forum](https://forum.dangerousthings.com/)
   - [Biohack.me](https://biohack.me/)
   - Reddit communities: r/biohackers, r/transhumanism

2. **Learn the Basics**
   - Understand RFID/NFC technology
   - Learn about biocompatible materials
   - Study proper sterilization techniques

3. **Experiment Externally First**
   - Get a Proxmark3 or NFC reader
   - Practice with external NFC tags
   - Understand how readers and tags communicate

## Your First Steps

### Step 1: Education

Read through this wiki to understand:

- [Types of implants available](implants-guide.md)
- [Required tools and equipment](tools-and-equipment.md)
- [Safety and legal considerations](safety-and-legal.md)

### Step 2: Community Engagement

Connect with experienced biohackers:

- Ask questions in forums
- Attend local hackerspace meetups
- Consider attending conferences like DEF CON's Biohacking Village

### Step 3: Start Small

If you decide to proceed with an implant:

- Start with well-established, simple implants (xNT, xEM, or NExT)
- Find an experienced professional installer
- Follow all aftercare instructions carefully

## Common Starter Implants

| Implant | Type | Difficulty | Common Use |
|---------|------|------------|------------|
| **xEM** | RFID (125kHz) | Beginner | Access control, cloning badges |
| **xNT** | NFC (13.56MHz) | Beginner | Sharing URLs, business cards |
| **NExT** | Dual-frequency | Beginner | Combined RFID + NFC functions |
| **xSIID** | NFC + LED | Beginner | Visual feedback + NFC storage |
| **xG3** | Magnet | Beginner | Sensing electromagnetic fields |

## Safety First

!!! warning "Important Safety Notes"
    
    - **Always use professional installers** — Never attempt self-installation without proper training
    - **Use implant-grade materials** — Only biocompatible, sterile products
    - **Know your medical restrictions** — Some implants are MRI-incompatible
    - **Have an aftercare plan** — Know how to care for the site and recognize complications
